## About the Application
The StacksOnStacks Capstone Project focuses on Congo, an ecommerce application selling a variety of items including apparel, accessories and electronics. It consists of a front-end, a back-end, and an h2 database. The application is made up of two repositories: one was developed using TypeScript and React for the front-end and the other was developed with Java and Spring for the back-end.

Congo offers many features for 3 types of users: Registered users, Guests (not registered or not logged in), and Admin users (staff). Some of these features include viewing products and their details, updating user profile, password reset, and dark mode. Also, there are some features exclusive to Admin users such as updating product details and modifying the products display page.

The main objective of this project was to plan and perform comprehensive API and E2E testing on these features from the application's front-end along with the endpoints developed on the back-end. Postman was used to test the API endpoints, while Selenium, Cucumber, and jUnit were used for the E2E testing of the features. In order to get the application running to view and run our automated testcases, please make sure you have the necessary software listed below, and refer to the STARTUP.md file for complete instructions.
